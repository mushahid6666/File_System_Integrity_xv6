# File_System_Integrity_xv6
In this project, you'll be changing the existing xv6 file system to add protection from data corruption. In real storage systems, silent corruption of data is a major concern, and thus many techniques are usually put in place to detect (and recover) from blocks that go bad.  Specifically, you'll do three things. First, you'll modify the code to allow the user to create a new type of file that keeps a checksum for every block it points to. Checksums are used by modern storage systems in order to detect silent corruption.  Second, you'll have to change the file system to handle reads and writes differently for files with checksums. Specifically, when writing out such a file, you'll have to create a checksum for every block of the file; when reading such a file, you'll have to check and make sure the block still matches the stored checksum, returning an error code (-1) if it doesn't. In this way, your file system will be able to detect corruption!  Third, for information purposes, you will also modify the stat() system call to dump some information about the file. Thus, you should write a little program that, given a file name, not only prints out the file's size, etc., but also some information about the file's checksums (details below)
